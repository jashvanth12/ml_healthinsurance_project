# Problem Statement: Health Insurance Premium Prediction
## Context
Health insurance companies determine premium amounts for customers based on various factors such as age, health status, income, and lifestyle habits. Accurately predicting the annual premium amount is crucial for both insurers and customers:

For insurers: Helps in setting fair and profitable pricing, reducing risk, and improving customer satisfaction.
For customers: Ensures they are charged a justified amount based on their risk profile and financial status.
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the annual premium amount a customer has to pay, using key demographic, health, and financial attributes.

Input Features (Independent Variables)
These features represent the factors affecting insurance premium calculation:

Demographic Details

Age: Older individuals may have higher premiums due to increased health risks.
Gender: Some insurance plans may vary based on gender.
Region: Geographic location may affect premium rates based on medical costs in that area.
Marital Status: Married individuals may get discounts or have different risk factors.
Number of Dependents: More dependents could increase coverage needs and costs.
Health-Related Factors

BMI Category: Higher BMI is often associated with health risks, increasing premiums.
Smoking Status: Smokers usually have higher premiums due to increased health risks.
Medical History: Individuals with a history of chronic diseases may pay more.
Financial & Employment Information

Employment Status: Stable jobs may indicate financial security, influencing premium affordability.
Income Level & Income (in Lakhs): Higher income groups may opt for premium plans.
Insurance Plan: The type of plan selected (basic, premium, etc.) directly affects the cost.
Target Variable (Dependent Variable)
Annual Premium Amount: The predicted insurance premium that a customer will be required to pay annually.
Business Impact
By implementing a predictive model for health insurance premiums, insurers can:

Provide personalized pricing based on customer profiles.
Optimize risk assessment to minimize losses.
Improve customer satisfaction by offering competitive and fair pricing.
Enhance operational efficiency by automating premium calculations.
