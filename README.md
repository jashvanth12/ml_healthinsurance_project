# Health Insurance Premium Prediction
# Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the annual health insurance premium a customer needs to pay based on key factors such as age, health status, income, and lifestyle habits. The insurance industry relies on risk assessment models to determine fair and competitive pricing for customers while ensuring profitability. However, traditional methods can be inefficient, inconsistent, and prone to human bias.

By analyzing demographic attributes (age, gender, marital status, and region), health-related factors (BMI, smoking status, and medical history), and financial details (income level, employment status, and insurance plan type), this model helps insurance companies automate premium calculation and optimize risk management.

The predictive model ensures that premiums are set fairly and accurately, reducing the likelihood of undercharging high-risk customers or overcharging low-risk individuals. This improves customer satisfaction, encourages affordable policy offerings, and enhances business efficiency by reducing manual effort in premium estimation.

Additionally, the project can be extended to dynamic premium adjustments, where policyholders can receive revised premium estimates based on their lifestyle changes. The insights from this model can also help insurance companies design better policies by understanding risk patterns across different customer segments.
